# The WORST GitHub repo ever !!
## What's Going On Here

I am a CS student, and this year we had to make a website as a school project.
Although I'm not in the front-end team, but I made this page just to demonstrate how our project's login page should look like, and also to practice on some styling and JavaScript.

Since this page is not the one we are going to be using in our project, I did not bother to write a clean code or making a good structure, so everything is in one folder, and you will find a lot of nonsense stuff.

To sum up, the login page looked great but the code is super duper bad.

## NOTE
For some reasons, if you open the html document with you browser it won't be styled, but if you use the Live Server extention it will be styled and good looking. So just install live server and open this html document using it.
